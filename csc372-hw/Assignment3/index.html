  This is the index.html page for my assignment 3. It gives three restaurant suggestions for students in the area and
  three images for each of those restaurants of food that I suggest they try from there. When the images are clicked on,
  they will increase in size and give a brief description of the food item. I also gave a brief description of the restraurant
    and their hours of operation.
